# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Arc Agentic Trading**.  
This project is part of an ongoing development effort and has both **public** and **internal** documentation. Please read carefully before making changes.

---

## General Principles

- **Public vs Internal Docs:**  
  - The public `README.md` in the repository is intentionally abstracted.  
  - Internal documentation (stored outside the public repo) contains the precise technical details.  
  - Contributors should always refer to the internal docs for implementation details.

- **Security:**  
  - Do not commit private keys, API tokens, or sensitive configuration.  
  - Environment variables must remain outside the repository.  
  - Follow best practices for secure handling of credentials.

- **Code Style:**  
  - Use TypeScript for agent orchestration.  
  - Use Solidity (0.8.x) for smart contracts.  
  - Maintain consistent formatting and linting rules.
